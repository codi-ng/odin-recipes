    <h2>How to make Empanadas</h2>
    <p>
        I didn’t choose the empanada life — the empanada life chose me. It was a rainy Tuesday in Milwaukee when a pigeon stole my sandwich and flew off into the mist. In my hunger-fueled desperation, I wandered into a community center where a woman named Doña Flor slapped dough like it owed her money. She handed me a mysterious golden pocket of joy and said, “This will fix everything.” She was wrong. It didn’t fix my credit score. But it did change my soul.

From that moment on, I devoted my life to understanding the sacred geometry of the empanada fold. I traveled across continents with nothing but a rolling pin, a dream, and a laminated picture of Guy Fieri for inspiration. I’ve made empanadas in mountaintop yurts, behind gas stations, and once during a minor hostage situation at a Chuck E. Cheese. Every filling I tried told me something new about myself. Spicy beef? I have unresolved issues. Ham and cheese? I fear intimacy. Sweet plantain? I might be lactose intolerant.

And now, dear reader, after 17 years, four travel bans, and one spiritual encounter with a talking goat named Ricardo, I present to you… the recipe. Use it wisely. Fold with love. Bake with passion. And remember — if your pastry doesn’t leak at least a little, you’re not living.

    <ol>
        <li>Make the filling: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pork and cook until completely browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes more. Drain fat from the skillet. Stir in raisins, olives, and hard-cooked eggs.

    Make the dough: Whisk milk and melted shortening together in a bowl until evenly blended. Stir flour and salt together in a separate large bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture; whisk until well combined and a dough forms. Let rest for 10 minutes.

<li>Blah blah blah</li>
